2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Submit a pull request** to the `develop` branch

## Development Guidelines

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Stable releases only
- `develop`: Active development
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for main

### Coding Standards

#### Shell Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Use bash strict mode
set -euo pipefail

# Include header comments
# Purpose: Brief description
# Usage: How to run the script

# Use meaningful variable names
organization_name="Your Org"

# Comment complex logic
# This loop iterates through all VMs
for vm in "${vms[@]}"; do
    process_vm "$vm"
done
```

#### Python Scripts

```python
"""Module docstring describing purpose."""

# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints when possible
def validate_config(config_path: str) -> bool:
    """Validate configuration file.
    
    Args:
        config_path: Path to configuration file
        
    Returns:
        True if valid, False otherwise
    """
    pass
```

#### Ansible Playbooks

```yaml
---
# Use descriptive task names
- name: Install and configure iPXE server
  hosts: ipxe_servers
  become: true
  
  tasks:
    - name: Install TFTP server
      apt:
        name: tftpd-hpa
        state: present
      tags: packages
```

#### YAML Configuration

```yaml
# Use 2-space indentation
# Add comments for complex options
network:
  # Subnet for client machines
  subnet: "192.168.1.0/24"
```

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, simple language (ELI5 approach)
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Add screenshots for UI-based instructions
- Test all commands and procedures
- Update table of contents when adding sections

### Testing Requirements

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

- **Scripts**: Add test cases in `testing/unit/`
- **Playbooks**: Test with `ansible-lint` and in a VM
- **Documentation**: Verify all links and commands work
- **Configuration changes**: Update `config.example.yaml` and validation schema

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer description if needed

Fixes #123
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
